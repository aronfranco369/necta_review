          "question_text": "Read the following passage and then answer the questions that follow.\n\nIn Africa, as was once the case for pre-industrial Europe, many children were born because they are highly-valued economic assets and because kinship system and religious beliefs encouraged families to have many children. Families would continue to have more and more children until desired number of boy-babies had been born. Babies are often felt to be blessings from the gods or the ancestors. In 1984, the average number of children per family was 6.43. This rate has not fallen during the last decade and in some countries it is still rising.\n\nSuch a youthful population needs expensive medical and education services, and many adults are involved in the caring for children and in educating them. In the more urban and industrialized societies, for example, women have more opportunities to join men in the economic world, because there are facilities provided by the state for caring for even young children.\n\nIn the modern world many countries have tried to control the growth of population. Many of the more industrialized societies have been more concerned about the threat of “overpopulation\", and have adopted program of birth control or Planned Parenthood. However, those policies have been fiercely resisted in the Third World. It is unlikely that in Africa, where the traditional valuation of children is so strong that governments would succeed in compelling people to have smaller families. Only a few countries have adopted national population policies, notably Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Tunisia and Mauritius. A few countries like Nigeria have voluntary agencies that offer advice about family planning. It is very doubtful if this advice (Limited to the main towns and used only by a few educated people) will have any noticeable effect.\n\nThe major obstacles in introducing population policies are social, religious and ideological. Equally serious is the reason that few administrators or political leaders, and very few of the ordinary people, appreciate the long term importance of relating population growth to trends in economic development. In too many African countries, there is no foreseeable way that food and other resources can match the population growth.\n\nQuestions",
