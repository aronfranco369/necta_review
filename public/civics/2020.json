Work is observed as great deal of industrious, diligent, effort and endurance accompanied with self-discipline. We work hard for things we think about and plan for, that will lead us to happiness, success or wellbeing. The path to success is hard work. There is no short cut, no easy way. We are all looking for values that can guide us in our lives. We want to make sense of what we do and why we do it. We are hoping that our life's purpose will lead us to success and eventually to happiness and peace of mind.\n\nRecently the government has taken serious efforts to encourage every adult and abled Tanzanian to work hard, not just for personal but also for national development. There are efforts taken to provide education to majority of citizens from primary level to tertiary level. The numerous vocational training centres intend to foster patriotism, self-reliance and efficient skilled labour for national development. We desire to offer our physical and mental ability to work, whether employed or self-employed. No one works hard for nothing; we have reasons for working hard, such as family to support, dreams to work toward and curiosities to satisfy. Work gives us innate sense of liberty inside all of us, helps us to survive, to amuse ourselves and we also want to make an impact and leave legacy when we die. Work gives us status in the community, fosters self-actualization and self-satisfaction. Working hard increases production; production contributes to tax, which is important for the government to deliver good social services. This is only possible if there is sense of commitment among the citizens.",
