But people cannot be developed; they can only develop themselves. Man develops himself by what he does, that is by making his own decisions, by increasing his understanding of what he is doing and why, by increasing his own knowledge and ability and by his own full participation as an equal member in the life of the community he lives in.\n\nThere are two factors, which are essential in the development of people. The first is leadership through education and the second is democracy in decision-making. For leadership does not mean shouting at people; it does not mean abusing individuals or groups of people you disagree with; it does not even mean ordering people to do this or that. Leadership means talking and discussing with the people, explaining and persuading. It also means making constructive suggestions and working with the people to show by actions what it is that you are urging them to do. Apart from that, it means being one of the people and recognizing your equality with them.\n\nQUESTIONS",
