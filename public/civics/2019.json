          "question_text": "Read the following passage carefully and answer questions (a) - (e) that follow.\n\nEducation is the creation, accumulation and transmission of values in a given society. It is designed to guide students in learning culture and molding behaviour on the way to adulthood, and directing them toward their eventual roles in the society. The existence of education is to help learners become useful members of the society. It should also help the learners to develop an appreciation of the cultural heritage of their society and live more satisfying lives.\n\nSchool is an institution designed to impart some of these societal values. However, there are claims that a number of school goers do not attend classes. This makes family institution more important in transmitting values in the society. A study conducted about the impact of truancy among the schools in Tanzania revealed that parents are child's first and perhaps most important teachers. Parents teach their children attitude, habits and values that help to shape their character. Parents remain with their children throughout their lives, but few parents have neither time nor ability to teach their children the things they need to know about life.\n\nTruancy has been labeled as one of the top ten major problems in schools, which negatively affect the future of the young people. Absenteeism is detrimental to student's achievements, promotion, graduation and employment potential. The students' notoriousness can be a result of truancy. Student's notoriousness resulting from truancy is not only confined to smoking, fighting with each other or behaving indecently but also involving in running away from home and mingling with friends of bad influence such as drug abusers. Truancy of students in Tanzania, is not only caused by attendance characteristics alone, but results from other factors like poverty, early child pregnancy, drug abuse, peer groups and lack of seriousness in classroom.\n\nConsequently, education stakeholders together with government and parents should apart from making sure that every school age individual attends school, children should take their learning seriously. There is a need for laws that students who do not attend classes regularly should be punished and their parents held accountable.",
