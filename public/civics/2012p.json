          "question_text": "Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow:\n\nBroadly speaking, the economy can be seen as operating within public and private sectors. The private sector is that part of the economy that is owned by private individuals and companies while the public sector is government owned.\n\nWhether the national economy should be driven by the state or by private run enterprises in a free market is a matter of principles. The former has been fast losing the battle under recent developments particularly in Tanzania.\n\nPrivate sector enterprises are thought to be more efficient than public enterprises because they have to be profitable to survive competition with other producers. Furthermore, the struggle for survival is a strong incentive for innovation. All these lead to the higher quality products and better services for the consumer.\n\nIn a state run economy with state owned enterprises and no free markets, there is little or no competition. Bankruptcy is not seen as a risk because the national treasury is there to inject capital when there is a crisis. As a result, there is no struggle for survival. The future of the enterprises and the jobs are so secure that there are few external forces that make efficient production necessary.\n\nPublic sector enterprises are accountable and responsible to political authorities. Such arrangement lowers the efficiency of the management of public undertakings and makes them tools in the hands of political establishments.\n\nThe arguments for a strong private sector economy have been gaining support throughout the world, including Tanzania. They have been strongly promoted by the World Bank and capitalist countries. Governments are discouraged to be involved directly in doing business but are, instead, advised to facilitate the existence of a good environment for the private sector. The idea seems to be that, the free market is neutral with regards to the welfare of the people.\n\nQuestions",
