Without chickens you get no eggs; and without eggs you soon have no chickens. Similarly, without freedom you get no development, and without development you very soon lose your freedom.\n\nFor what do you mean when we talk of freedom? First, there is national freedom; i.e. the ability of the citizens of Tanzania to determine their own future, and to govern themselves without interference from non-Tanzanians. Second, there is freedom from hunger, disease, and poverty. And third, there is personal freedom for the individual, i.e. his right to live in dignity and equality with all others, his right to freedom of speech, freedom to participate in the making of all decisions which affect his life, and freedom from arbitrary arrest because he happens to annoy someone in authority - and so on. All these things are aspects of freedom and the citizens of Tanzania cannot be said to be truly free until all of them are assured.\n\nYet it is obvious that these things depend on economic and social development. The extent that our country remains poor, and its people illiterate and without understanding or strength, then our national freedom can be endangered by any foreign power which is better equipped. This is not simply a question of military armament - although if these are necessary they have to be paid for out of the wealth of the community. It is a question of consciousness among all people of the nation that they are free men who have something to defend, whether the appropriate means of defence be by force or by more subtle methods.\n\nEqually obvious is the fact that freedom from hunger, sickness, and poverty depends upon an increase in the wealth and knowledge available in the community; for a group of people can only consume and use the wealth they have already produced. And even personal freedom becomes more real if it is buttressed by development.\n\nQUESTIONS:",
