The most common is through different international organizations. These organizations are in three main categories namely; global, regional and sub regional. This form of interaction may be for various purposes like political, economic and even sports.\n\nAt the political level, the most important organization since the Second World War is the United Nations Organization (UNO). It was established in 1945 with the main purpose of maintaining the world peace and security.\n\nThe main organs of the UNO are the General Assembly in which each member of the UNO is invited on equal terms. On the other hand, the Security Council has segregation with the five permanent members having the greater rights than others. These members hold Veto power which means that any one of them can block any decision in the Council. The permanent members are joined by other ten members who hold the position for two years. they are chosen on the basis of geographical location and other qualifications.\n\nNotwithstanding, the fact that the UNO represents the highest aspirations of the world's peoples for a world free of war, hunger, repression and suffering; there are very strong criticism of UNO performance. Some analysts have felt that UNO has been too passive in the pursuit of peace in the world particularly over the two decades. Cases like Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia and Palestine and Israel are illustrative.\n\nOn the African continent, the most important institution is the African Union (AU). This is a new organization established in 2002 transformed from currently non-operational Organization of African Unity (OAU). The OAU had a long history. It was established in 1963 by heads of states and governments of independent African Countries. Its main preoccupation was Liberation of African States and consolidation of independent African States. In the post liberation era on the continent, the African Union is expected to address economic and other problems facing Africa.\n\nQuestions",
