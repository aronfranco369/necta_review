Parents especially mothers play a key role in this process by encouraging the same cultural values and norms and attitudes she was taught and experienced in her lifetime. Thus social construction of gender role takes place at household level where girls and boys are assigned gender role by the parents. Patriarchy is the dominating established system that maintains the way by which children/ adult learn to behave as men and women without questioning.\n\nThe girl child is discriminated even before she is born. In some culture, the birth of a baby boy is highly celebrated compared to that of a girl. The song for boy child \"keep quiet my child you will grind for me, you will bring me water and firewood.\"\n\nIn most societies boys are viewed as pillars of strength, and keepers of property, bearers of clan name, also as permanent members of the family. By contrast girls are viewed as \"bearers of children and temporary members of the family.” Girls are denied the right to inherit land or family property.\n\nBasically, the girl child like her mother has limited chances to education, training and personal development due to unequal access to resources, cultural and religious beliefs. Today there are still people who believe that educating a girl is wastage of resources.\n\n Questions",
