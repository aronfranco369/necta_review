In Africa women produce more than 70 percent of the food for home consumption. men tend to produce for the market. Available data indicate that the time spent by women on farms tends to exceed that of men in many parts of rural Africa. In Tanzania women work for 16 hours a day compared to about 8 hours spent by men working. This indicates that women in Tanzania are involved in agricultural activities throughout the farming season. men seem to be concerned in the initial land preparation activities, thereafter involvement decreases considerably leaving the rest of the work to women.\n\nWomen in Tanzania are the main productive forces to rural communities. most of their daily activities are related to agricultural production, domestic chores and reproduction, They have almost total responsibility for subsistence farming as well as cash crops production. they do all this work using very poor farming implements like the hand hoe, which is unsustainable and almost cannot enable them to cultivate large farms.\n\nAlthough women are the main producers, it is mostly men in the village who take part in agricultural education where they learn new techniques particularly on how to utilize the new tools and equipments that are provided by the government through development programmes.\n\nWomen need assistance in the form of extension services, training facilities, credit and improved technology that would make agriculture more successful and less labour intensive.\n\nIt is important to challenge the myths and misconceptions which continue to portray men as thinkers, decision makers, directors and leading politicians, while at the same time they promote the concept of women as home makers preservers of traditions and cultures and submissive human beings. This is what gender sensitive men and women do to ensure equality and development.\n\nQuestions",
