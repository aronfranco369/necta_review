We must come to grips with a rational income policy which relates increases in wages to gains in productivity if we are to avoid serious problems over inflation or balance of payments. Trade Unions should also be thinking in terms of the national Welfare before meeting with employers over the bargaining table, and should take a more positive role in promoting rational development by improving systems of work incentives and creating greater stability in the labour force. They should also be working to establish workers' housing cooperatives, credit unions and other similar activities which are within their power to initiate. Unless the unions turn their attention to these matters, they may find that their present policies are creating substantial inequities in income distribution. If wages exceed productivity, employers may find it necessary to restrict the expansion of employment. The relationship of the Union Worker vis-a-vis the non- Union Worker may be increasingly difficult to sustain. If wage increases lead to price increases the non-union and the unemployed workers and their families are the first to suffer.\n\nOur incentives for stimulating the expansion of private industry may have also contributed to unemployment. They are patterned after incentive systems in advanced economies; economies in which there is a relative abundance of capital and a shortage of labour. Except for high and middle manpower of which there are some critical shortages, our position here is just the reverse.\n\nRapid population growth has also left its mark on the number unemployed. The government is giving its support to a programme of family planning education and we already have one of the most successful programmes in Africa. We hope that it will become more successful. This is one of the long range solutions to our development needs, however, and can have no impact on the size of the labour force for the next fifteen years.\n\nIt is a fact that rural areas are relatively less attractive places to live in than urban areas. To what extent are Government policies aggravating this situation? Are we placing too much emphasis on providing better urban facilities such as housing, water supplies, power and transportation at the expense of the rural areas? Should more emphasis be placed on farm to market roads, better rural marketing facilities, rural health services, rural schools and so on? If so how much more? These are novel questions. We in my Ministry, are asking them daily. We need your help and ideas in reaching even better solutions than the ones we have so far reached.\n\nQUESTIONS:",
