It is mainly for that reason that Tanzania has opposed the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons. We regard it as a most unequal treaty. The treaty asks non-nuclear nations, including potential nuclear states, to denounce the right to make or possess nuclear weapons, but it does not ask the nuclear powers themselves to stop making any more nuclear weapons; it does not ask the nuclear powers to destroy the weapons they already possess.\n\nFurthermore, it does not ask the nuclear powers to pledge that they will neither use nor threaten to use nuclear weapons against states which agree to sign the treaty. Instead, the nuclear powers, on their own, simply declare that they will protect non-nuclear signatories against nuclear attack.\n\nUnder this treaty even if a nation could swear upon the Bible, or the Holy Qur'an, that it wanted to develop nuclear explosives purely for peaceful purposes, it would not be allowed to do so. It must buy such explosives from the nuclear powers. This is the first time in history that a tremendous and far-reaching human discovery is made the monopoly of a few.\n\nQUESTIONS",
