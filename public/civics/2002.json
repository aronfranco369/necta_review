For example, scientific knowledge about how the eye works led to the invention of contact lenses. This use of scientific knowledge to solve a problem is referred to as technology. Sometimes new scientific knowledge is discovered as technology is being developed. For example after the telescope was invented, scientists discovered new planets and found out other things about space that they did not know before.\n\nScientific knowledge and technology has given people in developed nations high standard of living. People live in comfortable homes and travel by car or bus. They have enough food to eat and clothes to wear.\n\nBut science and technology has also caused problems in developed countries and the rest of the world. For example, the car enables people to get around quickly and easily, but it also pollutes our air. Many people are worried about the earth's air, water and soil; and the health of the earth's plants and animals. To protect the health of the earth and all its inhabitants, we must change some of the ways we use science and technology.\n\nOur society is made up of many individuals who must work together. The concerned members of any society take responsibility for looking after our world. Being a responsible citizen starts with thinking about your own actions. You could make wise and good decisions if you have the knowledge to help you make those decisions. As our society depends more and more on science and technology, it becomes everyone's responsibility to understand as much as possible about science and the use of technology around us.\n\nQuestions:",
