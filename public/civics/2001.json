Often, however, the concept of democracy conceals the reality of power exercised by some group of persons who try to maintain themselves in power. In this regard, democracy is not just the right to vote in a government or merely secure legal provisions in state constitutions or the right to speech, freedom to associate etc. Democracy is about a whole set of concerns which affords the citizenry the capacity to control their destiny.\n\nSince the 18th C Western Europe and early 20th C Africa and the current Eastern Europe democracy has been advanced by a combination of leaders of revolutions and popular movements. These institutions have fought for the right to be consulted in decision making, have pressed for the removal of barriers to their progress and have demanded for a central place in the governance process.\n\nThe driving force for these movements is the voluntary coming together of men and women for a common purpose to improve the society in which they live by demanding change from their rulers. In the countries of the North, that is Western Europe and North America the vehicles for demanding change and participation in the governance process have for a long time been interest groups that eventually aggregated into political parties which in turn contested for political power. Then as time went by political parties have been one of the major instruments of the citizenry in their desire to effect democracy in their societies.\n\nQuestions:",
