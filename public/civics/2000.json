By order, or even by slavery, you can build pyramids and magnificent roads, you can achieve expanded acreages of cultivation and increase the quantity of goods produced in your factories. All these things and many more can be achieved through the use of force; but none of them results in the development of people. Force and deceitful promises can, in fact only achieve short term material goals. They cannot bring strength to a nation or a community and they cannot provide a basis for the freedom of the people or security for any individuals or group of persons.\n\nThere is only one way in which you can cause people to undertake their own development. That is by education and leadership. Through these means - and no other - people can be helped to understand both their own needs, and the things which they can do to satisfy these needs. This is the kind of leadership which any ruling party and Government officials should be giving the people; this is the way in which we can bring development to Tanzania. Although we must give this leadership, the decisions must come from the people themselves, and they themselves must carry out the programmes they have decided upon.\n\nQuestions",
