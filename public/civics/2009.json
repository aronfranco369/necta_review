Yet, it has been enjoying very little attention from the authorities. The agricultural sector is still underdeveloped, peasant-based and productivity is low resulting in extreme poverty.\n\nTanzania has more than 44 million hectares of arable land, and a large amount of water resources and a wide variety of agro-ecological zones and climates. But less than 30 per cent of it is being used for production.\n\nFor the past two decades, agricultural GDP has grown at a low average rate of 3.3 % per annum falling far short of the needed growth of about 10 per cent. As a result, no investor has ever shown interest in investing in the sector since the liberalisation policy was put in force 20 years ago.\n\nThe existing poor infrastructure has magnificently been attributed as a contributing factor to that state of affairs. The Land Act of 1999 has also reported to be giving a hand to the problem that has made investors shy away from the sector.\n\nEssential social services like water and electricity which are key components in agricultural production are still far from being realised, making it difficult for anyone with a good amount of money to invest in agriculture.\n\nQuestions",
