          "question_text": "Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow.\n\nAbout thirty million people live in Tanzania and only a small number of these are lucky enough to receive secondary education. This causes a great problem, as education can provide people with many advantages. It is often possible for an educated man to become rich and important, and if he does so it is very likely that he will become selfish. He may think to himself, \"I am fully educated, I am clever\". Everybody must admit that this attitude of superiority cannot be accepted. We can not have two nations, the educated on one side and everybody else on the other or even worse, the educated on top of uneducated keeping them down. Such an attitude can not be allowed to exist, and we have to consider the best ways of removing it.\n\nOne of the best ways is to make sure that the students in the schools do the same kind of work as the people do. One advantage of this is that the schools will be producing their own food. But it will also mean that no-one will go through school with selfish ideas that he/she is too well educated to do physical work.\n\nThere are other ways of giving the students close contact with the world outside school. For example, secondary school students can teach adults to read and write. Pupils in schools must realize that there is a world outside school, which does not have the advantages of education, but which is just as important as they are. It is the people who live in this outside world who are paying for the education which students are receiving, so that education is in fact a debt which the students owe them. The debt can only be repaid in the end by the ex-students using their skills and efforts to help the people who did not receive so much education.\n\nThey expect and hope that their lives will be improved by the knowledge and skill of the educated few. Students are certainly lucky to have a chance to get education, but they must remember that their education is not for themselves alone, but for many others, who paid for it.",
