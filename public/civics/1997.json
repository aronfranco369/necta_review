These protect plants or the environment from being attacked by pests. Ignorance on the effects of pesticides can cause great harm to the environment and there is a danger of upsetting the delicate ecosystem.\n\nIt is thus vital to promote environmental awareness and publicize effective conservation measures.\n\nArmed with little knowledge many people have been misusing and mishandling pesticides, thus endangering the environment, man, animals, and plants. The common effects have been in the form of explosions, contamination of water sources and plants which are later consumed by humans and animals. Contamination of the ecosystem has consequently led to the imbalance in the relationship between animals and plants.\n\nThe factors often cited by experts which have led to the misuse and mishandling of pesticides include illiteracy, negligence, poor documentation and information systems, poor disposal techniques and lack of technical know-how, ignorance, the absence of an appropriate guiding policy and insufficient extension services.\n\nQUESTIONS:",
