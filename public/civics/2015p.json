The most dangerous one are those that are addictive. Addictive drugs produce a biological or psychological dependence in the user and their withdrawal leads to a thirst or desire for the drugs that in some cases may be nearly irresistible.\n\nAddictions may be biologically based. In this case the body becomes so accustomed to functioning in the presence of a drug that it cannot function in its absence. Also addictions may be psychological in which case people believe they need the drug in order to respond to the existing stress of daily living.\n\nFurthermore, the easy availability of some illegal drugs and the pressures of peers all play a role in the decision to use them. In some cases, the motives are simply the thrill of trying something new and perhaps bending the law. Regardless of the forces that lead a person to begin to use drugs, drug addiction is among the most difficult of all behaviors to modify, even with extensive treatment.\n\nQuestions",
