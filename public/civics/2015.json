The International Labour Organization estimates that 215 million children between the age of 5 and 17 currently work under conditions considered illegal, hazardous or extremely exploitative. Under age children work at all sorts of jobs around the world, usually because they and their families are extremely poor.\n\nThese child labourers suffer extreme illness, exploitation, injuries and death in underground mines, open cast mines and quarries. Children as young as 6 or 7 years old break up rocks, sieve and carry ore, some of them especially girls work in domestic services, sometimes starting as young as 5 or 6 years. These types of child labour are linked to child trafficking. Domestic child labourers can be victims of physical, emotional and sometimes sexual abuse.\n\nWorse still domestic child labourers, particularly girls, have been considered as sexual objects by male members of the family and in some cases including heads of the families. Additionally, sexual protective gears such as condoms may not be used in the actions, as a result the house girl may conceive, get infected with STIs, HIV and AIDS or both. In most cases a pregnant girl may be chased out of the house without any help, forced to take an abortion or sometimes given a few money which is enough for bus fair to reach her parents' home. These options are taken to avoid leakage of information on her pregnancy and confrontations in the family.\n\nQuestions",
