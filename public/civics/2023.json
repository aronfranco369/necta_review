The term street vended food describes a wide range of ready to eat food and beverages sold and sometimes it is prepared along streets and several other public places which include; lorry stations, parks, schools, construction sites and virtually all location where there is high number of potential customers. It is accessible everywhere, convenient, inexpensive, delicious, authentic, culturally enriching and relatively healthful.\n\nThe food vendor sector is growing not only because people need food but also due to the lack of formal job which influence the growth of the sector. Most unemployed college or school graduates in many African countries fall back to street food vending. The reason being the initial capital is low and is affordable. Food vendors are categorized into two groups based on how they operate their food vending activities. There are food vendors who travel from one place to another on bicycles, motorcycles or tricycles carrying a glass case which contain the food intended for sale. Most of the time the food is prepared much in advance and stored under unfavorable conditions. The second category is stationary food vendors who have stalls which are immovable at a point usually on the road side or under a shop where they prepare or cook food instantly. Every day these vendors store their bulky goods such as tables and benches in their caravan.\n\nIn Tanzania the recognition of the economic value of the informal sector came shortly after the economic hardship in the early 1980's. The most remarkable feature of the informal sector is its diversity and heterogeneity. The sector comprises individuals from all steps of the economic and education ladder. There is a need for the government authorities to provide facilitation to this sector through licensing, allocation of spaces for business premises, financial services, health and quality control, setting rules and regulations and policy management.",
