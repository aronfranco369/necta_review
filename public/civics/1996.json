Everyone of you know how close we are geographically. I believe that the distance between Zanzibar and Pemba is greater than the distance between either of these islands and the East African mainland. Similarly, history tells us that at one time Zanzibar and a large part of mainland Tanganyika were ruled by one Government, that of the Sultan of Zanzibar. It was an accident of history that we did not continue to be one country. When the colonialists partitioned the East African countries they agreed that Zanzibar and Pemba island and the coastal strip of Kenya should come under the British, while both the coastal strip and the hinterland of Tanganyika and Zanzibar should be ruled by the Germans. That is how Tanganyika and Zanzibar were separated. After the First World War, when the East African countries came under the British rule, the division was maintained. Independence has given us an opportunity to rectify this.\n\nToday, there is in Africa great enthusiasm for Unity. The people of our continent are anxious to become one people, with one government. This is a very big thing. In no other part of the world is there so great an urge for unity as we find in Africa. But whilst we are rightly proud of this aspiration, this sentiment of unity, we must remember that meaningful unity will not come simply by talking.\n\nActions must demonstrate our determination, and show that a single Government in Africa is not an impossible dream, but is something which can be realized.\n\nCountries which are friends and neighbours, and which at sometime in their history have been united, have a special responsibility. If they fail to unite, their failure will be used to point the finger of scorn at our continent. But if they do unite, and make their unity into a living reality, they will be demonstrating that the hopes of our continent are not vain ones. If two countries can unite, then three can; if they can, then thirty can.\n\nTanganyika and Zanzibar are neighbours geographically, historically, and linguistically; they are neighbours by custom and culture, and by politics. The friendship between the Afro-Shiraz Party and TANU is well known to you all. The friendship between the leaders of these two Parties did not start yesterday. We have all these reasons to unite; on top of it all we have the overall African desire for unity. And we have the Will also.\n\nQuestions",
