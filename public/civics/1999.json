Just because something is technically feasible in the U.S.A., does not make it economically viable, socially desirable or sustainable in Tanzania. In the West, for decades, engineers and designers have been looking for capital - intensive technological 'solutions' because in their economic and social contest, labour is relatively expensive and mechanisation/computerisation is relatively cheap.\n\nIn most developing countries, however, the reverse is true: labour is plentiful and relatively cheap. Population growth and mass under-employment are among the major challenges to be faced. At the same time, imported capital - intensive technologies are relatively expensive, if not ruinous in gobbling up precious foreign exchange.\n\nIn particular, capital-intensive, high technology interventions can have a huge but often unpredictable impact on the lives of thousands of people. The construction of a major new road, for example, may bring heavy plant labour gangs and large influx of cash wages, in the short term, to an area which previously relied on subsistence agriculture. In the longer term, improved transport may mean that local farmers start to produce crops for cash, or may lead to rural depopulation.\n\nAll of this may form part of somebody's idea of progress; but many of these developments will be unpredictable or unstable and most of them will take place without the involvement of local people in the planning process.\n\nFor these reasons, there is an interest in most developing countries in technical approaches, which minimise the use of imported materials and techniques, and which maximise the use of locally available materials, skills and labour (even if design and production 'improvements' of an intermediate kind are required.\n\nQUESTIONS",
