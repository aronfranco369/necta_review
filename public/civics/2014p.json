          "question_text": "Read the following passage and then answer the questions that follow.\n\nThe government in 1983 allowed private operators, now famously known as Daladala, to provide public transportation services for the city population. While Usafiri Dar es Salaam (UDA) fleet size has dwindled and now comprises conventional and minibuses, the number of registered Daladala has dramatically increased to 4500 operational in 1997.\n\nDaladala operate in almost all municipalities throughout the country. The fleet is very diverse in both type and capacity but the majority have a passenger capacity ranging from 16-36. In most routes the 36 passenger capacity buses dominates. The majority of Daladala vehicles are imported as reconditioned vehicles or bought second hand from Japan and the Middle East. The routes operated range from less than 3 kilometres to long routes of approximately 30 kilometres, the latter being peri-urban routes. Services are not scheduled and vehicles only leave a rank when they are full. Daladala drivers usually start work at approximately 0430-0500 and finish at 2300-2400. Most Daladala vehicles have been operated for less than 8 years in Dar es Salaam region. However, the average age of Daladala vehicles may be up to or more than 10 years.\n\nDriver's remuneration is generally not fixed but is commission based. Some operators stipulate revenue targets to be achieved by their drivers. Both methods of remunerating the Daladala drivers encourage speeding, overtaking, poor parking and frequent vehicle stoppage to pick or drop passengers on their way to anticipated destinations. Most of the drivers employed in the Daladala business are very young. There are no laid down procedures for driver's recruitment. For instance, a driver discharged by one operator can be reengaged by another operator in a matter of hours without even ascertaining the reasons for dismissal. Consequently, driver turnover is very high. There are no driver training programmes for the majority of drivers.\n\nQuestions",
