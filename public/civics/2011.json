However, this contribution has neither been recognized nor acknowledged by society, especially the decision makers who have mostly been men.\n\nIn Tanzania for example, during the struggle for independence in the 1950's women did a lot in campaigning but during elections were rarely voted into parliamentary seats.\n\nOn the issue of education, parents and community at large preferred to educate boys more than girls. At family level decision making was done by the father and the rest of the members were just obeying.\n\nAfter independence things changed a bit where few girls had access to school. However, subjects remained the same, gender stereotyped ones. As a result women's roles were ignored due to lack of decision making within and outside their homes. Decision making on issues like reproductive health, family size and child spacing were not within their power.\n\nThe main cause of this discrimination of women is the wrong beliefs and customs through informal education. Stakeholders and leaders responsible for issues related to women development should sensitize and educate the people about equality. This can be done through training, employment and financial support for small business because when educating the women, the entire nation is educated.\n\nQuestions",
