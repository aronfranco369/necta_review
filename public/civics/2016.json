          "question_text": "Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.\n\nHistorically the question of human rights has been constantly attracting International attention. In different places all over the word Tanzania included, human rights are being violated at different levels ranging from the central government itself, local government, public institutions such as court and police, society and even at the level of the family and religion to mention few. Due to ignorance caused by lack of information and poverty, the victims of human rights do not know that they are violating them.\n\nTo combat the problem of violating human rights in Tanzania appropriate measures need to be taken. The first alternative is the on-going improvement of human rights education to the entire public. All citizens should be educated on human rights. Authorities such as police, people's militia, executives, members of the parliament, councillors, teachers, employers and parents should know human rights.\n\nThe second steps is to know where to go when human rights are violated. In most cases violations occur to individuals. The court system and the police are the major organs that protect human rights. However, these organs may not help if human rights education is not provided. There is a need to form local human rights groups which will serve well even when an individual alone cannot get his/her rights. Such groups can be formed by students, women, workers, villagers or professionals, disabled, retired employers etc.\n\nThese groups will serve as regulators when any person or group is denied his/her rights. They will have a strong and common voice against any violation. This behaviour will enable even law enforcers such as police, tax officers, magistrates and judges to be careful when doing their duties. This will ensure and enhance the commitment of lawyers and judges to interpret the laws accordingly.\n\n Questions",
