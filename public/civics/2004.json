All the evidence however, clearly demonstrates that the poor are getting poorer.\n\nThe reason why there is little effect on poverty reduction is that most aid is spent on heavily capitalized infrastructure projects such as railways, bridges and roads. These may have some indirect effect on the lives of poor people, but what people really want is better health and education services, improvement in village roads rather than highways and access to proper credit facilities to help them improve agriculture and raise their income.\n\nAlthough there are some enlightened donors, most big western governments and UN agencies find these types of projects too small-scale and difficult to measure and administer. They would rather give money for power stations and fertilizer plants, since such things can be seen and their performance can be measured.\n\nThey also look impressive in glossy magazines telling the tax payers back home, how the government is spending their money.\n\nQUESTIONS",
