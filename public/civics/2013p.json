          "question_text": "Read the following passage and then answer the questions that follow.\n\nThe wave of struggle for democracy which swept through many countries since the late 1980s triggered the demand for the multi-party system. But then many questions came to the fore. One of the questions is whether it is not possible to have democracy without a multi-party system. It is not easy to reach a consensual conclusion on this issue. But many people agree that having one political party by law minimizes the right of political participation for those who dislike that single party. Because of this, western countries insist that true democracy has to go hand in hand with the freedom to form parties. In those countries, various political parties contest for peoples' votes and the party which win forms a government and the rest remain as opposition parties.\n\nOne important benefit of the multi-party system is that it provides an opportunity to form a different government when the ruling party loses in an election. This provides an equal opportunity for various political parties and politicians to rule on behalf of the voters. It is said that this opportunity for change in the leadership of government provides better chances to formulate and implement better policies for the benefit of the people. It is also said that the existence of opposition parties makes the government constantly keen in serving the people, for one of the roles of the opposition parties is to challenge and correct the government in power.\n\nSome experts in questions of democracy have warned that opposition under multi-partism does not always promote democracy. They believe that where there are weak opposition political parties which merely make empty speeches at political platforms, democracy may be weakened. A useful opposition is one where political parties are strong, with a broad social base.\n\nQuestions",
